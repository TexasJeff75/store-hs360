# Pricing Management Component - Temporarily Disabled

The PricingManagement component has been temporarily disabled while removing the Secret Costs feature.

## What was removed:
- Secret cost tracking system
- Cost admin permissions
- Product costs table
- All secret cost UI elements

## To re-enable:
The component needs to be rebuilt without secret cost references.
The basic contract pricing functionality should work but needs the secret cost code cleaned up properly.

## Current Status:
Component file exists but has broken syntax from automated removal of secret cost code.
Needs manual cleanup to restore basic pricing management functionality.
