## Executive Summary

### Overall Compliance Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLIANT

The application has strong technical security measures but **lacks critical privacy compliance components** required by GDPR and CCPA.

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention:
1. ❌ **No Privacy Policy** - Legal requirement missing
2. ❌ **No Cookie Consent Banner** - GDPR/CCPA violation
3. ❌ **No Data Export Feature** - GDPR Article 20 violation

**Cookie Policy:** Placeholder only  
**Tracking Disclosure:** None

#### Cookies/Storage Used:
| Name | Type | Purpose | Expiry | Consent Required? |
|------|------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| sessionStorage | Essential | Session tracking | Tab close | ⚠️ Informational |

---

### 8. Sensitive Product Categories

#### ℹ️ INFORMATIONAL

**Context:** Application sells health and wellness products (peptides, genetic testing kits)

**Note on HIPAA:** This is an e-commerce platform, not a healthcare provider. HIPAA does **not apply** because:
- No direct patient-provider relationship
- No medical records or treatment information collected
- Products sold directly to consumers (B2C retail)
- No claims processing or healthcare operations

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Product purchases may reveal health interests
- Standard e-commerce privacy protections apply
- GDPR/CCPA consumer rights still required
- Consider additional transparency about product categories in privacy policy

---

|-------|-------------|--------|
| Notice at collection | CCPA 1798.100 | ❌ Missing |
| Access personal data | CCPA 1798.100 | ❌ Missing |
| Delete personal data | CCPA 1798.105 | ❌ Missing |

- No designated method for requests
- No 45-day response process

---

2. **Create Terms of Service**
3. **Create Cookie Policy**
4. **Implement Cookie Consent Banner** (with Accept/Reject/Customize)
5. **Add Privacy Consent Checkbox** to signup flow
6. **Create Data Subject Request Process** (email-based minimum)

#### P1 - High Priority:
7. **Implement Account Deletion Feature**
8. **Implement Data Export Feature** (JSON format minimum)
9. **Update Footer Links** to actual policies
10. **Document Data Retention Policy**
11. **Create DPA with Supabase**

13. **Create User Data Dashboard** (view all collected data)
14. **Add Consent Management** (track, view, withdraw)
15. **Implement Marketing Preferences**
16. **Create Breach Response Plan**
17. **Document Data Processing Activities** (GDPR Art. 30)

## Legal Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Consult Legal Counsel** - Privacy attorney specializing in e-commerce
2. **Appoint DPO** - Data Protection Officer (GDPR requirement if processing at scale)
3. **Register with ICO** - If processing UK/EU data
4. **File CPRA Registration** - If annual revenue > $25M or processing 100K+ CA residents

### Risk Assessment:

**Current Legal Exposure:** 🔴 HIGH

**Potential Penalties:**
- **GDPR:** Up to €20M or 4% of annual revenue (whichever is higher)
- **CCPA:** $2,500-$7,500 per violation

**Risk Factors:**
- No privacy policy = intentional non-compliance
- EU/CA users without proper consent = per-user violations
- E-commerce handling payment data increases scrutiny

## Technical Implementation Guide

### 1. Cookie Consent Banner

```typescript
// Recommended library: cookie-consent-manager
// Must appear on first visit
// Must block non-essential cookies until consent
```

### 2. Account Deletion Feature

```typescript
// src/services/userDataService.ts
async deleteAccount(userId: string): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Anonymize order history (keep for tax compliance)
  // 2. Delete personal identifiers
  // 3. Delete auth account
  // 4. Cascade deletion via ON DELETE CASCADE
  // 5. Log deletion for audit
}
```

### 3. Data Export Feature

```typescript
// Export all user data in JSON format
async exportUserData(userId: string): Promise<UserDataExport> {
  return {
    profile: await getUserProfile(userId),
    orders: await getUserOrders(userId),
    addresses: await getUserAddresses(userId),
    payment_methods: await getUserPaymentMethods(userId),
    sessions: await getUserSessions(userId),
    consent_records: await getConsentRecords(userId)
  };
}
```

### 4. Consent Management

```typescript
// Track all consent given
interface ConsentRecord {
  user_id: string;
  consent_type: 'privacy_policy' | 'terms' | 'marketing' | 'cookies';
  consented_at: timestamp;
  withdrawn_at?: timestamp;
  ip_address: string;
  user_agent: string;
}
```

2. ✅ **Add cookie consent banner** (Week 1)
3. ✅ **Implement data export** (Week 2)
4. ✅ **Implement account deletion** (Week 2)
5. ✅ **Consult legal counsel** (Immediately)

### Timeline to Full Compliance:

- **Phase 1 (Critical):** 2-4 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Enhanced):** 1-2 months
